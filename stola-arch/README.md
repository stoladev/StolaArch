# StolaArch

This is my personal toolset used each time I do a clean OS install.

## Contents

- Installation script, run ASAP.
- Clean script, run once a month.

## ToDo's

- Update scripts to work out of the box with Arch, removing the current Archbang
  requirement.
- Run Clean.sh automatically on installation finish, creating a cronjob that
  reminds the user once a month to approve it to run again.
