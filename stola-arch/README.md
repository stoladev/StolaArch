# StolaArch

This is my personal toolset used each time I do a clean OS install.

## Contents

- Installation script, run after partitioning/chroot
- Clean script, run once a month

## ToDo's

- [âœ“] Update scripts to work out of the box with Arch
- [ ] Set up user profile and password within script
- [ ] localegen and time settings
- [ ] Create common cleaning actions script to keep Arch nice and light
- [ ] Run Clean.sh automatically on installation finish
- [ ] creating a cronjob that reminds the user once a month to run again
