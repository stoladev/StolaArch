# Shell Projects

All of my Shell projects will be located here. Any scripts that I deem "daily
use" will not be included here; instead, they are located in my [dotfiles
repository.](https://github.com/stoladev/dotfiles)

## Categories

- StolaArch
    - My installation script that I run on every new Archbang installation.
      Also contains my clean script that should be run ~ once a month.
